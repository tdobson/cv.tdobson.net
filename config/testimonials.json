A while after St George's Healthcare NHS Trust was looking at moving from a Windows based server to a Linux based one as part of a website redevelopment. I immediately got in touch with Tim as not only do Bytemark offer such a great service at such a low price but their support and engagement with clients is excellent. He helped to pull together quotes and to explain the options with my colleague (who had the budget but lacked web server knowledge), this made everything easier for the final decision to be made.",

Tim is also capable of understanding and implementing effective marketing, as demonstrated through the rapid growth of the group. Tim's web development work and technical skills have also ensured that the group's website is easy to navigate but functions well. This website is used for everything from holding member details, to facilitating payments for membership (subscription) and events/training (one-off payments), to monitoring metrics such as training, volunteer status and more. To be able to take The Climbing Clan from a small group of friends with a shared interest, to a growing, sustainable, community of hundreds of members is an achievement that can only be attributed to hard work, dedication and an ability to recruit and motivate the right people to support a vision. It is these attributes that would make Tim an asset to any business.",
